    <p>Now, let us venture into the realm of falafel, a culinary delight renowned across the lands. With a base of ground chickpeas or fava beans, mixed with aromatic herbs and spices, these crispy, golden-brown orbs are a treasure to behold. Served alongside fresh pita bread, tahini sauce, and a medley of pickled vegetables, falafel transports you to the bustling streets of Cairo.</p>
    <h3>The Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dry fave beans</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs:</li>
        <li>Leek</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>How To Do It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all the above ingredients in a food processor and process several times until you achieve your desired texture. </li>
        <li>I like my falafel a bit grainy like the texture above, some people like it very fine so it is really up to your taste.</li>
        <li>Now for the fun part, using a whisk or your electric beaters, beat for like 5 minutes. Yes 5 minutes until it gets really airy and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Form falafel into balls or discs dip in sesame seeds (optional) and fry in hot oil until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
